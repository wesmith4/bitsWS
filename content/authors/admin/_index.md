I'm a recent graduate of Davidson College with career aspirations in tech, product management, financial planning, consulting, and private equity. Complementing my education in Economics, I have pursued a variety of disciplines and experiences, including a semester living abroad in Peru, a tech bootcamp semester in San Francisco, and internships in both B2B SaaS and consumer e-commerce.  I am currently seeking opportunities to contribute my passions and skills toward companies driven by strong missions and great products!
