I'm a senior at Davidson College with career aspirations in tech, product management, financial planning, consulting, and private equity. Complementing my major in Economics, I have pursued a variety of disciplines and experiences, including a semester living abroad in Peru, a tech bootcamp semester in San Francisco, and courses in data science and applied mathematics.  I am currently seeking roles and opportunities to contribute my passions and skills toward companies driven by strong missions and great products!
