Welcome to **bitsWS**!  I created this site to serve as a hub for all of my academic and professional content, including blog posts, personal projects, and publications for school.  Navigating through the homepage, you can find my profile information and listings of my posts and projects.  As I further develop the site, I will expand the breadth of content displayed on the homepage to reflect my work.

Please feel free to reach out to me through any of the methods presented on the site - [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/williamesmithiv), [GitHub](https://github.com/wesmith4), [email](mailto:wismith@davidson.edu), or comments on my posts and projects.  I'd love to connect!


## Tools Used
I am using a number of different tools in the creation and development of this site.  Most of these tools require some technical skills, which I have developed over the duration of my education at Davidson College, from a combination of courses and independent learning.

### Domains
This site lives on the [bits.wesmith4.com](https://bits.wesmith4.com) domain, a subdomain of my [wesmith4.com](https://wesmith4.com) top domain provided by Davidson Domains (thank you, Davidson!).  **bitsWS** is *hosted* by [**Netlify**](https://netlify.com), a service to serve websites with continuous deployment from a linked [repository](#repository).

### Repository
The code and content for bitsWS lives in my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/wesmith4/bitsWS) for this site.  I edit the site on the local copy of this repository on my computer, and then push my changes to the remote repository on GitHub.  Every time I push, Netlify automatically rebuilds the site
from the new changes.

### Hugo Site Builder
The format and design for bitsWS comes from the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site builder, one of the most popular resources for generating websites.  I am using the "Academic" theme from Hugo, which provides a framework for managing content such as posts, projects, and publications, as well as presenting a professional profile on the homepage.

### RStudio
I will be using this site to write and post some data science content. In this line of work, I use the R language through RStudio, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built especially for data science. For these posts and publications, I will be using the Bookdown/Blogdown libraries built for RStudio.  Writing content using R Markdown allows me to generate elements like tables and graphs from R code chunks in my posts.
