<p>My name is Will Smith, and I am a rising senior at Davidson College, where I’m pursuing a major in Economics with an additional focus in Applied Mathematics. Approaching my final year of college, I wanted to extend my knowledge and skills in these fields with some published work available online. Thus, I have decided this summer to pursue a data science blog covering topics in agriculture, especially their economic implications.</p>
<div id="background---why-agriculture" class="section level2">
<h2>Background - Why Agriculture?</h2>
<p>I have long been interested in farming and agriculture, for their obvious role in bringing food and other necessary items to the tables of the world. When I was younger, I had the opportunity to travel with my family to Iowa, where my grandfather owns a corn and soybeans farm. I’m sure my younger self was just ready to get out of the car after hours of driving through fields, but I appreciate having this experience observing a small part of big agriculture first-hand.</p>
<p>In Fall 2019, when I studied abroad in Peru, I took a course at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú called “Economía Agraria” (Agrarian Economics). This course proved very difficult, as the professor was discussing pretty advanced material at a fast pace for three hours at a time, and I was one of only two non-native Spanish speakers in the class. Nonetheless, it was fascinating to learn about and research the intricacies of agricultural systems in Peru.</p>
<p>This past spring, I took part in Davidson’s Liberal Arts in Silicon Valley program, in which I developed a lot of new skills in Javascript and other web development languages. I learned how to build functional web pages and web apps, such as a crowd-sourced thesaurus, an online recipe box, and a intra-campus communication app. This new ability to create content online gave me the desire to continue putting things out there for people to see my work.</p>
<p>Having some experience with data science in R from a course in Spring 2018, I decided to start this blog to bring together my interests in economics and agriculture and my skills and abilities to create and publish content online. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Tools and Sites Used</h2>
<p>I am generating the content for this blog through a combination of R Markdown, Blogdown, and Hugo. The site is published to a Netlify site, which serves my personal tech and data science domain <a href="https://bits.wesmith4.com">bitsWS</a>. At least for now, all of the data I will be using comes from <a href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home">FAOSTAT</a>.</p>
