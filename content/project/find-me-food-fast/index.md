## My first web app
"Find Me Food Fast" was the first web app I put online during my Spring 2020 semester with Adjacent Academies.  As I fiddled around on a Friday in late February with integrating the GitHub repository with "this site called _Heroku_ - have you heard of it?", little did I know that I was laying the foundation for a workflow I would repeat practically every week for the remainder of the semester.

## How it started
The last week before our spring break during the Adjacent program, we had transitioned from creating static web pages to making _dynamic_ websites (web apps) to accept user input to a server and send/render a response. For our end-of-week project that week, we decided to split into teams a little differently - rather than having the instructors assign groups, we had a _draft_.

Initially, each of the 14 of us was to brainstorm some project ideas, then hone in on just one to present - pitch - to the group.  After the round of pitches from the cohort, we voted on five most popular projects to move forward.  The respective "team captains" of these projects then picked their teammates NFL Draft-style from the rest of the cohort, and we began working furiously on our projects to get a viable product for presentations the next day.

## The Idea
Our meal plan for the semester in San Francisco (tragically cut short by the coronavirus) was, in a word, unbelievable.  With a weekly stipend through the Ritual app, we literally had no choice but to eat each and every meal at restaurants in a city where the variety and quality of food are both top-notch.  There was just one snafu - the app's ability to do complex filters of participating restaurants is somewhat limited.
