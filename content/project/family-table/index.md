In mid-March, our Davidson in Silicon Valley program transitioned from our locations on-site in San Francisco to remote learning due to the rising COVID-19 pandemic conditions.  We all experienced very new, unique, and unprecedented living sitations, whether with our families, friends, or other relations.  Despite these unfortunate circumstances, I did find some good in our new situation - I got the opportunity to live at home with my family for an extended period for the first time in a couple of years. One great aspect of living at home was that I got the benefit of all of the home-cooked meals I enjoy so much.

When brainstorming for my individual capstone project, this enjoyment of family recipes and home-cooked meals gave me the inspiration for **My Family Table**.  As I approached the end of my junior year of college, I naturally was thinking to the future, when I would be more independent.  I enjoy cooking, and there have been many times when I texted my mom to ask for a picture of a certain recipe, or live instructions.  I thought to myself, "we should just make an online version of our recipe box" - and then began work on this web app.

## React - a failed attempt
<!-- ![react](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/1280px-React-icon.svg.png) -->

The week before our individual capstone projects, I had begun experimenting with React.js, wanting to learn how to use the framework to create a dynamic frontend for web apps. As I thought about the layout and functionality of My Family Table, I knew that I would need a dynamic form for new recipes - one that would allow users to add and delete input elements for ingredients and steps.  Based on this one need, I decided that I would develop the frontend of My Family Table as a React app. However, as I learned late Tuesday of our project week, this was a big mistake that cost me a lot of time and gave me plenty of headaches.


I realized that implementing React involves a whole lot more than presenting elements like the ticking clock from the tutorial or the dynamic form from my site.
